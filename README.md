# Multi-Agent App on Databricks

A production-oriented multi-agent AI application on Databricks for governed tool routing, hybrid authorization, and environment-aware deployment.

## Why This Project

Modern AI applications are moving from single-model chatbots to orchestrated systems that can:

- Route requests to specialized agents and tools
- Ground responses on governed business data
- Stream responses in real time for interactive UX
- Ship safely through multi-environment CI/CD

This repository provides an MVP foundation that can scale to enterprise use cases.

## Technology Perspective

This project uses a modern AI app stack on Databricks:

- Multi-agent orchestration: one orchestrator routes intent to specialist backends.
- Tool-augmented reasoning: Agents call tools instead of relying on model-only answers.
- Managed app runtime: Databricks Apps hosts the full stack.
- Agent-native serving runtime: MLflow Agent Server with ResponsesAgent handlers.
- OpenAI-compatible agent loop: OpenAI Agents SDK + Databricks OpenAI Responses API.
- MCP integration for enterprise context: Genie tool access through MCP.
- Governed data access: Unity Catalog permissions and SQL warehouse controls.
- Hybrid authorization model: per-tool app identity and user identity (OBO) routing.
- Deployment-as-code: Databricks Declarative Automation Bundles with target overlays.
- Streaming-first UX: React + TypeScript frontend with incremental token streaming.

## Functionality Perspective

The app provides:

- Unified endpoint: A single app endpoint for multi-tool, multi-agent interaction.
- Dynamic routing: Requests are routed to Genie, serving endpoints, or app-based specialists.
- Real-time responses: Streaming responses for conversational latency.
- Configurable specialist set: Subagents can be added and validated through typed configuration.
- Auth-aware tool routing: each subagent declares `auth_mode` (`app` or `obo`).
- Governed routing policy: persona, tool-targeting, identity, and data-classification checks run before tool execution.
- Response guardrails: governed responses enforce evidence/citation requirements and sensitive-output safety checks.
- Environment isolation: dev, qa, stg, and prod with explicit target-specific settings.
- Operational fallback path: Direct apps deploy path when Terraform registry availability is degraded.

## 5-Minute Start

If your Databricks CLI profile is already configured, this is the fastest way to run and validate locally:

```bash
uv run quickstart
uv run preflight
uv run start-app
```

What this does:

- `quickstart`: prepares local environment and baseline config.
- `preflight`: validates local startup, health endpoint, and `/invocations` request path.
- `start-app`: runs backend and UI for interactive testing.

For deployment, continue with the standard bundle flow in Quick Start.

## Authorization Model

The runtime uses a hybrid authorization model:

- App Authorization: tools execute with the app service principal identity.
- User Authorization (OBO): tools execute with the forwarded user access token.

Subagent authorization is configured in `src/backend/domain/subagents.json` using `auth_mode`:

- `auth_mode: app`
- `auth_mode: obo`

Current defaults:

- Genie subagents default to `obo` when not explicitly set.
- Non-Genie subagents default to `app` when not explicitly set.

The backend loads this file at startup and validates it with typed models in `src/backend/domain/subagent_config.py`.
Override the path with `SUBAGENTS_CONFIG_PATH`.

If an OBO tool is selected and no forwarded token is present, the runtime raises a clear user-facing authorization error instead of falling back silently.

## Governance and Observability

Lifecycle and policy events are emitted through the message bus. Backend selection is environment-driven:

- `structured_logging` (default)
- `noop`
- `kafka`
- `rabbitmq`
- `uc_table` (Unity Catalog-governed Delta audit table)

For governed execution, the runtime emits policy allow/deny decisions and response guardrail pass/block outcomes.

## UI Token Commands

The React UI supports session-scoped token commands for OBO testing:

- `/token <databricks_access_token>`: store a forwarded token for this chat session.
- `/clear-token`: clear the forwarded token from this chat session.

When set, the UI forwards the token to backend `/invocations` as the `x-forwarded-access-token` header.

## Core Architecture

High-level request path:

1. User message enters React UI.
2. Request reaches Databricks App endpoint.
3. MLflow Agent Server dispatches invoke or stream handlers.
4. Orchestrator selects tools and specialist agents.
5. Tools query Genie or serving endpoints.
6. Unified response is returned to the client.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.11+
- uv
- Databricks CLI

Run locally:

```bash
uv run quickstart
uv run start-app
```

Validate and deploy:

```bash
uv run prepare-app-source
databricks bundle validate -t dev --profile dev
databricks bundle deploy -t dev --profile dev
databricks bundle run multiagent-app --target dev
```

If bundle deploy fails due to Terraform provider registry availability, use the operational fallback documented in [docs/operations/runbook.md](docs/operations/runbook.md).
