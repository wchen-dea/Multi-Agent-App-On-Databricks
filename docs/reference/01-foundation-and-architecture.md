## 4.1 End-to-End Request Flow

1.  A user or application submits a request through an authenticated
    Databricks App, internal service, or API endpoint.

2.  The application layer validates identity, workspace access, service
    entitlement, rate limits, and request metadata.

3.  The orchestration layer determines whether the request requires
    direct inference, retrieval-augmented generation, tool execution,
    feature lookup, or a multi-step agent workflow.

4.  The retrieval layer fetches governed context from Delta Lake, Vector
    Search, Bedrock Knowledge Bases, OpenSearch Serverless, or S3-backed
    knowledge stores.

5.  The model layer invokes the appropriate Databricks or AWS model
    endpoint, applying prompt templates, guardrails, grounding context,
    and policy controls.

6.  The response is validated for safety, groundedness, formatting, and
    tool-execution constraints before being returned to the user or
    downstream workflow.

7.  Telemetry, traces, evaluation signals, audit logs, and cost metrics
    are emitted to MLflow, Databricks system tables, CloudWatch,
    CloudTrail, and operational dashboards.
