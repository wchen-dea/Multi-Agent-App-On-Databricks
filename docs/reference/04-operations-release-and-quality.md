# 9. Evaluation, Observability, and Operational Requirements

- Every AI release must pass deterministic evaluation gates before
  promotion, including regression tests, golden-question tests,
  retrieval quality checks, safety tests, latency tests, and cost
  benchmarks.

- Use MLflow for experiment tracking, prompt/version management, trace
  collection, model evaluation, and production monitoring across agents,
  LLM applications, and ML models.

- Capture production telemetry including request volume, latency, token
  usage, model errors, retrieval hit rate, groundedness score, tool
  invocation success, user feedback, and cost per request.

- Use CloudWatch, Databricks system tables, logs, metrics, alerts, and
  dashboards to monitor platform health and trigger incident response
  workflows.

- Define SLOs for availability, p95 latency, answer quality, retrieval
  freshness, model error rate, and incident response time.

### 12.3.1 Acceptance Criteria Writing Checklist

- State the requirement in observable pass/fail language.

- Reference the related requirement ID, risk ID, or control ID.

- Define the verification method, evidence artifact, and accountable
  approver.

- Include quantitative thresholds where the metric is known; otherwise
  define the approval process for establishing the threshold.

- Include negative tests for unauthorized access, unsupported prompts,
  unsafe tool execution, missing context, and failure recovery.

- Confirm the criterion can be validated before production release and
  monitored after release.
