# ADR Index

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture durable technical decisions for this project.

## ADR Conventions

- Filename format: `NNNN-short-kebab-case-title.md`
- Status values: `Accepted`, `Superseded`, `Proposed`
- Required sections: `Status`, `Context`, `Decision`, `Alternatives Considered`, `Consequences`, `Implementation Notes`
- Update policy: when a decision changes materially, create a new ADR and mark older ADRs as `Superseded` rather than rewriting history.
